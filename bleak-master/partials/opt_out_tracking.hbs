FULL DISCLOSURE - this tracking tag helps me, the developer of bleak, measure
its reach and usage, assess the uptake of new features and the kinds of device
it's being used on.

IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO OPT OUT OF THIS. See unwitting.github.io/bleak
for more information. A version of bleak which is identical in every other
way to this one, but without this tracking, is and always will be available.

Thanks for reading ‚ù§
